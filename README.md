# Chimp test

This is a small game built using Svelte meant to recreate [The Chimp Test](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/chimp) found on Human Benchmark. You play by analyzing a grid that contains randomly placed, numbered tiles. Once you have them memorized, you must try to click them in order without being able to see the number labels. Each round you succeed, the board will be randomized and a new tile will be added, making it gradually more difficult. This project was built using [SvelteJS](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript).
